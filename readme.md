[Intervention Image's](https://github.com/openregion/image) driver to use the library with
[libvips](https://github.com/libvips/libvips). libvips is a fast, low-memory
image processing library that outperforms the standard PHP image extensions GD
and Imagick. This package makes it easy to utilize the power of libvips in your
project while taking advantage of Intervention Image's user-friendly and
easy-to-use API.

This repository contains the `openregion/image-driver-vips` fork maintained for PHP 8.1+ compatibility.

## Installation

Install this library using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org). Simply request the package with the following command:
    
```bash
composer require openregion/image-driver-vips
```

## Getting Started

The public [API](https://image.intervention.io) of Intervention Image can be
used unchanged. The only [configuration](https://image.intervention.io/v4/basics/configuration-drivers) that needs to be done is to ensure that
`Intervention\Image\Drivers\Vips\Driver` by this library is used by `Intervention\Image\ImageManager`.

## Code Examples

```php
use Intervention\Image\ImageManager;
use Intervention\Image\Drivers\Vips\Driver as VipsDriver;
use Intervention\Image\Alignment;
use Intervention\Image\Format;

// create image manager instance using the desired driver
$manager = ImageManager::usingDriver(VipsDriver::class);

// read image data from path
$image = $manager->decodePath('images/example.webp');

// scale image by height
$image->scale(height: 300);

// insert a watermark
$image->insert('images/watermark.png', alignment: Alignment::BOTTOM_RIGHT);

// encode edited image
$encoded = $image->encodeUsingFormat(format: Format::JPEG, quality: 65);

// save encoded image
$encoded->save('images/example.jpg');
```

## Requirements

- PHP >= 8.1
- Foreign Function Interface (FFI) Extension

## Caveats

- Due to the technical characteristics of libvips, it is currently **not possible**
  to implement color quantization via `ImageInterface::reduceColors()` as
  intended. However, there is a [pull request in
  libvips](https://github.com/libvips/php-vips/issues/256#issuecomment-2575872401)
  that enables this feature and it may be integrated here the future as well.

- With PHP on macOS, font files are not recognized in the
  `ImageInterface::text()` call by default because Quartz as a rendering engine
  does not allow font files to be loaded at runtime via the fontconfig API.
  However, setting the environment variable `PANGOCAIRO_BACKEND` to
  `fontconfig` helps here.
